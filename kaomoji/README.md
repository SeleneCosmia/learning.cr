# kaomoji-cli

### A commandline kaomoji catalog written in î˜¯ [crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal)î˜¯
---
Current Usage is limited to a help and version option parser as this project is under active development, stay tuned ðŸ«¡


- TODO:
  - add functionality beyond the option parser help/version message
  - potentially split kaomoji into categories basded on emotions, further dividing into
    other arbitrary categories like animals, characters, etc.
  - determine which fonts will be being used to render the kaomoji to figure out which fonts
    should be marked as dependencies.
        <sub>the bold __AND__ italicized are definites for testing as they are my 3 most used terminals</sub>
  - further test in __*Kitty*__, __*WezTerm*__, __*Rio*__, *Contour*, *Alacritty*<sup>maybe? idk i don't really use it but i know it's a popular choice?</sup>, and others.... maybe. no promises, but you're free to do so yourself!
