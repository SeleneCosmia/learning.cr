This is my personal repo where i keep track of my various [crystal-lang](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) projects I'm messing around with to learn the lang through developing random projects that cross my mind and seem challenging and great learning opportunities withthe added bonus of contributing to a much smaller ecosystem in an underappreciated lang tat I've admired from afar for quite some time now.

### So what's all here?

1. __kaomoji__
    kaomoji is a WIP commandline catalog of a ton of different kaomoji friends ~and foes?~
    Eventually this will contain a fully functioning database of sorts that serves no **"real"** use, but is cute and
    fun so ¯\(ツ)/¯
